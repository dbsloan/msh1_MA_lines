Summary of generating mitochondrial and plastid SNV and indel variant calls.

- `organelle_variants.sh` outlines script calls and input files and notes where manual filtering was performed to generate intermediate input files
- Filtered SNV and indels in [final_callsets](final_callsets) directory
- Scripts for generating plots in the [figures](figures) directory
- Primer sequences and Sanger sequence data for SNV validation in [sanger_validation](sanger_validation) directory
- Additional plastid SNVs detected with lower variant frequency threshold in [lower_frequency](lower_frequency) directory
