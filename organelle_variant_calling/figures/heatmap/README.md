R code and input files to generate heatmap of variants in WT vs msh1 mutant MA lines.

- Variant frequencies included normalization ot mean WT background levels are in mito_heatmap.xlsx and plastid_heatmap.xlsx
- Exported as simple data matrices compatible with pheatmap: mito_heatmap_matrix_only.csv and plastid_heatmap_matrix_only.csv
- R code in variant_heatmaps.R used to generate mito_heatmap.pdf and plastid_heatmap.pdf output files.
